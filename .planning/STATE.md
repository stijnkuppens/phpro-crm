# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Every feature from the demo CRM must exist with full backend persistence, server-first data flow, and multi-language support
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Reference Data

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation & Reference Data)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-20 — Roadmap created, ready to begin Phase 1 planning

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase by domain — complete one domain fully before moving to the next (matches PROJECT.md constraint)
- Roadmap: Contracts split into Phase 4 (domain) + Phase 5 (consultant detail) for fine granularity
- Roadmap: Revenue analytics (Phase 6) precedes Prognose (Phase 7) because prognose depends on revenue_entries data
- Research: recharts must stay on v2.x (shadcn not yet ported to v3); requires `react-is` override for React 19
- Research: Prognose has zero DB schema — migration must be created before any UI work in Phase 7

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 7 risk:** Prognose feature has no `queries/` or `actions/` directories — UI exists but resets on every visit. Migration design needed before Phase 7 starts (key schema question: how to model `mode` and 12-month spread — separate columns vs. jsonb).
- **Phase 4 risk:** Indexation approval must write to both `hourly_rates` AND `indexation_history` — verify DB rows after each approval, not just UI completion.
- **All phases:** Every new list feature's acceptance criteria must include "filter works correctly on page 2" to catch server-side vs. client-side filter regressions.
